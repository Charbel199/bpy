# Mesh to Pointcloud

A triangle surface sampler used to generate pointclouds from blender meshes.

This code was inspired by Jakub Uhlik's [repository](https://github.com/uhlik/bpy/blob/master/space_view3d_point_cloud_visualizer.py).

_Note: This is not a blender add-on, it is meant to be used in code only_
